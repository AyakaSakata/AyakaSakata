Hi, I am Ayaka Sakata @Institute of Statistical Mathematics, Tokyo, Japan.
I am interested in Statistical Physics and Statistics.
For details, see my webpage https://www.ism.ac.jp/~ayaka/ or google scholar https://scholar.google.co.jp/citations?user=15HfJWIAAAAJ&hl=ja&oi=ao

The avatar, whose picture I took more than 7 years ago, is an alpaca that lived in Rakujuen.
I hope he/she is still well.
